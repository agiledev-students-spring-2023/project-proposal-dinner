# Project Proposal

### Project title

What's For Dinner?

### What and why?

Imagine it's Thursday night and you have an exam tomorrow morning. You've studied all day, so you want to eat a nice homecooked meal to feel good for your test. However, it's already pretty late and you don't have time to run to the 24/7 Bodega to grab ingredients. Don't you wish that there was a way to find great recipes online with ONLY the ingredients you already have in your fridge and pantry? Well, "What's For Dinner?" is the answer to that question.

What's For Dinner is a project that I want to build that will solve the scenario above and others like it. The ingredients that you currently have in your apartment/dorm are the sole input for this project. In theory, the project will be able to find recipes from the internet that only use the ingredients that you currently have in stock. 

The importance of this project is to help college students (or anyone to be honest) eat healthier, learn the art of cooking, save money, and save time. 

### For whom?

Since college students are usually pinched for time and money, this project is designed for them in mind. However, it is 100% useful to any human being with a kitchen and some groceries.

### How?

Input: A list of grocery items that you currently have in your kitchen (e.g., Tomatoes, Rice, Eggs, Olive Oil, Bananas, Milk, Bread).
Output: A list of recipes that only use the items that you provided. 
Addditional Features (These are just optional ideas that could enhance What's For Dinner?):
- Find recipes that require 1, 2, ... , n more ingredients that you do not have. Basically, you might not have all of the ingredients for this recipe, but you are only missing a couple (a number that you can set) and a quick trip to Trader Joe's is possible. 
- Sort recipe's based on various factors (e.g., difficulty, time, type of cooking, cuisine, etc).
- Be able to specify how many people you want to cook for. This will filter the output to recipes that are fit for the amount of people you plan to make food for.

### Scope

To be honest, I'm not sure that I can answer this question properly as I have never created a project like this, but I will try my best.

I think that the hardest part of this project would be finding (or creating) a good database of recipes. My first thought was to webscrape, but recipes online are usually in different formats, so that might be difficult. However, with a team, anything is possible :) 

Another solution for this could be to use an API. I've looked at a few online and Spoonacular seems to have support for most of what is described above. 

Assuming we have a way to store all the recipes and access them, making the input/output seamless is the next step. The input would have to be a system that allows the user to type in as many items as one would like and then allow the user to press a "Find Recipes" button that generates the output. The output is described above in the How? section. 

I don't think that this project is too easy because even if the minimum input/output needed to create a working program is able to be completed quickly (I don't think that it will, but incase it does), there is an unlimited number of additional features that could enhance the project. I've listed a few above, but I'm sure that more will be thought of. In addition, making the project easier to use, better looking, faster, etc. are also enhancments that will defintely take time and effort. For these reasons, I don't feel that this is an easy project, however, I also don't think that it is too ambitious for a semester as the project can be broken down into pieces and with enough work from 4-6 people and the resources from class and the internet, it should be feasible.
